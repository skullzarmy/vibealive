# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other people
- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being collaborative** and supportive in code reviews and discussions
- **Recognizing and crediting** the contributions of others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Dismissing or attacking inclusion-oriented requests or discussions
- Sustained disruption of community discussions or events

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:

- GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Code reviews and technical discussions
- Community forums and chat platforms
- Conference presentations and meetups
- Social media interactions related to the project

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

To report violations:

1. **GitHub Issues**: For public violations visible in the repository
2. **Direct Contact**: Email project maintainers for private matters
3. **GitHub's Reporting System**: Use GitHub's built-in reporting features for serious violations

### Investigation Process

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. When a report is made:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will review the incident thoroughly and fairly
3. **Decision**: We will determine appropriate consequences based on our guidelines
4. **Communication**: We will communicate our decision to relevant parties
5. **Follow-up**: We will monitor the situation to ensure resolution

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Building an Inclusive Community

### For Contributors

- **Welcome newcomers**: Help new contributors get started and feel included
- **Share knowledge**: Be patient when explaining concepts or reviewing code
- **Credit others**: Acknowledge contributions and give credit where due
- **Learn from mistakes**: Treat errors as learning opportunities, not failures
- **Ask for help**: Don't hesitate to ask questions or request assistance

### For Maintainers

- **Set the tone**: Model inclusive behavior in all interactions
- **Provide clear guidance**: Offer constructive feedback and clear expectations
- **Be responsive**: Acknowledge contributions and respond to questions promptly
- **Foster diversity**: Actively encourage participation from underrepresented groups
- **Resolve conflicts**: Address issues fairly and transparently

### Communication Guidelines

#### In Code Reviews

- **Focus on the code, not the person**: "This function could be optimized" vs "You wrote slow code"
- **Provide specific feedback**: Include suggestions for improvement
- **Acknowledge good work**: Highlight positive aspects of contributions
- **Ask questions**: "Could you explain this approach?" vs making assumptions

#### In Discussions

- **Listen actively**: Consider different perspectives before responding
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions focused and productive
- **Use inclusive language**: Avoid terms that exclude or marginalize others
- **Assume good intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt

#### When Disagreeing

- **Be respectful**: Disagree with ideas, not people
- **Provide reasoning**: Explain your perspective clearly
- **Seek understanding**: Try to understand the other viewpoint
- **Find common ground**: Look for areas of agreement

## Positive Interaction Examples

### Good Code Review Comments

```
✅ "This implementation looks solid! Consider using async/await here for better readability."
✅ "Great test coverage! Could we add a test case for the error scenario?"
✅ "Thanks for this contribution! The documentation is very clear."
```

### Constructive Issue Discussion

```
✅ "I'm experiencing a similar issue. Here's my environment details..."
✅ "This feature would be helpful for my use case. Here's how I envision it working..."
✅ "I found a workaround that might help others: [solution]"
```

### Welcoming New Contributors

```
✅ "Welcome to the project! Thanks for your first contribution."
✅ "Great question! Here are some resources to help you get started..."
✅ "I'd be happy to mentor you through your first PR."
```
