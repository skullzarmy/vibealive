# VibeAlive for Next.js

VibeAlive is a powerful, framework-aware code analysis tool designed specifically for Next.js applications. It helps you identify unused files, dead code, and redundant API endpoints, keeping your projects clean, performant, and maintainable.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Framework-Aware Analysis:** Intelligently detects your Next.js version and routing patterns (App Router, Pages Router, or hybrid).
- **Unused Code Detection:** Builds a complete dependency graph to accurately identify orphaned files and components that are no longer referenced.
- **API Endpoint Analysis:** Scans your codebase to find unused API endpoints.
- **Multiple Report Formats:** Generates reports in JSON (for machine consumption), Markdown, and other formats.
- **Local-First MCP Server:** Includes a built-in MCP-compliant server for programmatic access and integration with LLM agents.

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Analyzing a Project

The primary command is `analyze`. It scans your project and generates a detailed report in the `./analysis-results` directory.

```bash
npx vibealive analyze <path-to-your-project> [options]
```

**Example:**

```bash
npx vibealive analyze .
```

**Options:**

| Option                  | Description                                             | Default              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `--format <formats>`    | Comma-separated list of output formats (json, md, etc.) | `json,md`            |
| `--output <dir>`        | Directory to save reports in.                           | `./analysis-results` |
| `--exclude <patterns>`  | Comma-separated glob patterns to exclude.               | (none)               |
| `--confidence <number>` | Minimum confidence threshold for findings (0-100).      | `80`                 |

### Using the MCP Server

For programmatic access or integration with LLM agents, you can start the local MCP server. This provides a powerful, machine-readable interface to the analysis engine.

```bash
npx vibealive serve [options]
```

**Options:**

| Option                | Description                    | Default |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- |
| `-p, --port <number>` | The port to run the server on. | `8080`  |

For detailed examples of how to interact with the server, see the [MCP Client Example](./examples/mcp-client.ts).

#### ðŸš¨ Security Note

The MCP server is designed for **local use only** and binds to `localhost` by default. This is a critical security feature to prevent unauthorized access to your code and analysis results.

If you choose to expose this server externally (e.g., using a tool like `ngrok` or by binding to `0.0.0.0`), you are responsible for implementing your own authentication and security measures. **Do not expose the default server to the public internet.**

For full technical details on the MCP API, including all methods and data models, please see the [MCP Server Documentation](./MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md).
